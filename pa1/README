Introduction:
This project implements a fixed depth decision tree algorithm using Python (2.7).  The algorithm uses "Information gain" as the deciding factor for splitting a node. And the combo of feature and value, which gives us the best "Information gain" is used for the split at a particular node. This algorithm does binary splits using the one vs rest approach for every possible feature. 


Limitations of the project:
1) The algorithm only supports binary splits. 
2) The algorithm does not work as expected if the test/training dataset has missing values.

Running Application:   

PLEASE CHECK THE OUTPUT.TXT FILE, IT HAS THE ENTIRE OUTPUT.
The application has already been run with the ouput stored in the 'output.txt' file. 
If you wish to run the program again, 

The sytax of the command which has to be executed can be seen below:

	python decTree.py 
		or
	python decTree.py > output.txt	

IMPORTANT : 
If you wish to implement the decTree.py on your own dataset, then change the file names in decTree.py. Comments have been added for where you can do this. Have a look at the decTree.py file.
