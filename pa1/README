Introduction:
This project implements a fixed depth decision tree algorithm using Python (2.7).  The algorithm uses "Information gain" as the deciding factor for splitting a node. And the combo of feature and value, which gives us the best "Information gain" is used for the split at a particular node. This algorithm does binary splits using the one vs rest approach for every possible feature. 


Limitations of the project:
1) The algorithm only supports binary splits.
